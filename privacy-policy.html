  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 01, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Expense Tracker</strong> app (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to transparency and security.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App collects only the information you manually enter to use its features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> Amount, category (e.g., food, bills, savings), short description, and payment method.</li>
    <li><strong>Wishlist Data:</strong> Item name, estimated amount, target date, priority level, short description, and notes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>No personal identifiers</strong> such as name, email address, or location are required to use this app.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data is used solely to enable expense tracking and wishlist management.</li>
    <li>No data is shared, sold, or transmitted to any third-party services or servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All your data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store your data on external servers. If your device is lost or data is deleted, it cannot be recovered unless you have created a manual backup.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you enable future optional features such as cloud backup, your data will be encrypted and transmitted securely using HTTPS.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can add, edit, or delete your expense and wishlist data at any time within the app.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app will permanently remove all locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
  <p>The App works offline and does not require an internet connection for its main features. Internet access may only be required for future optional services, such as backup or updates.</p>

  <h2>6. Permissions We Request</h2>
  <p>The App may request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to remind users to record expenses or wishlist updates (intervals such as 2 hours, 6 hours, or 8 hours).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All permissions are requested only when necessary and are never used for background tracking or data collection.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Expense Tracker does not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or any third-party SDKs. However, Google Play may collect diagnostic data and crash reports as per their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
