  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 09, 2025</p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how our app handles your data. This app is designed to operate fully offline and does not send, store, or share any of your information externally.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Our app does not collect or transmit any personal or usage data. There are no forms of telemetry, analytics, user tracking, or background data syncing involved in the operation of the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All information entered or generated within the app is stored locally on your device. This includes, but is not limited to, user notes, preferences, and settings. We do not have access to this data in any way.</p>

  <h2>3. No Internet Connectivity</h2>
  <p>The app does not require an internet connection to function and does not communicate with any servers or third-party services. This ensures your data remains private and confined to your personal device.</p>
